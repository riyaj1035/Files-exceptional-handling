        "1.What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " -  Compiled languages translate all code to machine code before execution (like C++), making them fast but requiring a build step, while interpreted languages translate and execute code line-by-line during runtime (like Python/JavaScript), offering faster development but slower performance; modern languages like Java use a hybrid approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        " -  Exception handling in Python is the mechanism that lets you manage errors that occur while a program is running so the program doesn’t crash unexpectedly. Instead of stopping execution when something goes wrong, Python allows you to “catch” the error and handle it gracefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " -  The primary purpose of the finally block in exception handling is to define a section of code that always executes, regardless of whether an exception was thrown or caught. It is most commonly used for resource cleanup to ensure the program remains stable and efficient\n",
        "\n",
        "4.What is logging in Python?\n",
        " -  Logging in Python is a built-in mechanism for recording events that happen while a program runs. Instead of using print() to debug or monitor programs, logging provides a flexible, professional way to track information, warnings, errors, and system behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, __del__ is a special method known as a destructor.\n",
        "Its purpose is to define what should happen just before an object is destroyed—typically cleanup tasks like releasing external resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        " -  | `import`                        | `from ... import`                |\n",
        "| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |\n",
        "| Imports entire module           | Imports specific items           |\n",
        "| Access via prefix (module.func) | Access directly (func)           |\n",
        "| Cleaner & safer                 | Convenient but risk of conflicts |\n",
        "| Preferred in large projects     | Good for frequent-use items      |\n",
        "\n",
        "7.How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, you can handle multiple exceptions using a single except block with a parenthesized tuple of exception types or by using multiple, specific except blocks for different handling logic. For cases where multiple exceptions are raised simultaneously, Python 3.11+ introduced ExceptionGroup and the except* syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        " -  The with statement in Python is used to manage resources like files safely and efficiently. When handling files, its main purpose is to automatically open and close the file, even if an error occurs while working with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        " -  Multithreading (Concurrency)\n",
        "Definition: Multiple threads of execution within one process, sharing its memory and resources.\n",
        "Resource Use: Lightweight; faster to create and less memory-intensive.\n",
        "Communication: Easy and fast (shared memory).\n",
        "Best For: I/O-bound tasks (waiting for network/disk).\n",
        "Challenge: Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python limits true parallel execution on a single core for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
        "Multiprocessing (Parallelism)\n",
        "Definition: Multiple independent processes, each with its own memory space and resources.\n",
        "Resource Use: Heavyweight; slower to create, more resource-intensive.\n",
        "Communication: Requires Inter-Process Communication (IPC) (pipes, queues), more complex.\n",
        "Best For: CPU-bound tasks (heavy calculations) to utilize multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "Benefit: Bypasses Python's GIL, enabling true parallel execution\n",
        "\n",
        "10.What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        " -  Debugging and Troubleshooting: Logging provides insight into a program's execution flow, variable states, and function calls, which is crucial for identifying the root causes of errors or unexpected behavior during development and after deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "11.What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " -  Memory management in Python refers to how Python allocates, uses, and frees memory during program execution. Python handles most memory operations automatically, so developers rarely manage memory manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "12.What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        " -  Enclose the Suspect Code: Place the code that might cause an error inside a try block. This block is the primary area where an exception is monitored as the code runs.Catch the Exception: Immediately following the try block, use one or more except blocks to define how to handle specific errors (exceptions) if they occur within the try block. Each except block specifies the type of exception it can catch.\n",
        "\n",
        "13.Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        " -  Memory management is important in Python because it directly affects a program’s performance, stability, and resource usage. Even though Python handles memory automatically, understanding and managing it well helps prevent inefficiency and crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "14.What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " -  Role of try and except\n",
        "try block: This block contains the code that might potentially raise an exception or an error. The program attempts to execute the code within this block normally .\n",
        "except block: If an exception is raised inside the try block, the execution flow immediately jumps to the corresponding except block. This block contains the code responsible for handling the error gracefully—such as displaying a user-friendly error message, logging the error, or attempting a fallback operation\n",
        "\n",
        "15.How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " -  Python’s garbage collection system automatically manages memory by finding and freeing objects that are no longer needed, so programmers don’t usually have to manually deallocate memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16.What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " -  In Python exception handling, the else block is used to define code that should run only if no exception occurs in the corresponding try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17.What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " -  The common logging levels in Python, from least to most severe, are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. Each level is assigned a specific numeric value and serves a distinct purpose in monitoring application behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "18.What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " -  Key Differences at a GlanceFeatureos.fork()multiprocessingLevelLow-level system callHigh-level libraryPortabilityUnix/Linux onlyCross-platform (Windows/Mac/Linux)StateCopies entire parent memoryCan spawn fresh or fork (configurable)Ease of UseDifficult; requires manual PID checkingEasy; uses classes and functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "19.What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " -  Closing a file in Python is important for several reasons, primarily to free up system resources, ensure data integrity, and prevent potential errors in your programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "20.What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        " -  | Feature           | `file.read()`          | `file.readline()`    |\n",
        "| ----------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |\n",
        "| What it reads     | Entire file or n chars | One line per call    |\n",
        "| Memory usage      | Can be large           | Efficient            |\n",

        "\n",
        "21.What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        " -   The logging module in Python is used to record (log) messages about what your program is doing while it runs. It helps with debugging, monitoring, diagnosing problems, and auditing behavior—especially in larger or long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "22.What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " -  The os module in Python provides functions to interact with the operating system. In file handling, it is mainly used to manage files and directories, handle paths, and access file-related system info—things that open() alone cannot do.\n",
        "\n",
        "23.What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        " -  Python's memory management, while largely automatic via garbage collection and reference counting, presents challenges like memory leaks (especially with cyclic references), GC overhead causing latency, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) impacting multi-threaded memory access, and potential memory bloat if developers aren't mindful, leading to high usage or slow performance. Developers need to be aware of object lifetimes, choose efficient data structures, and use profiling tools to manage large applications effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "24.How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        " -  In Python, you use the raise keyword to manually raise (or \"throw\") an exception. You can raise built-in exceptions or define and raise your own custom exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "25.Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        " -  Multithreading is important in certain applications because it lets a program perform multiple tasks concurrently within the same process, improving responsiveness, throughput, and resource utilization."
